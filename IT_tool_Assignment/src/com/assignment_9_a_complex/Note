Ranjay Sir ,


Question : Why only printBill method in main class's switch ?

Ans : This printBill method calculates purchase of all type of customer
 and does calculation and prints Bill by
run time object creation(run time polymorphism) .

If I enter  1 : then classicCustomer will get invoked and it will calculate discount and prints Bill
for only classicCustomer .

if i enter 2: it works for platinium only and so on ..

i have implemented polymorphism through printBill() ;   method .
